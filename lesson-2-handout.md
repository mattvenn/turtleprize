# Lesson 2

## Variables

If we want a computer to remember something, we have to use a variable. Variables allow us to store and then retrieve data.

We use the single `=` to assign a number to a variable. Variables can be called pretty much anything, but there can be no spaces in the name. It's a good idea to choose a name that matches the variable's use. 

So for this example, I'll call the variable 'test_var'.

Remember that the lines beginning with a `#` are comments - you don't need to type them in.

~~~ { .python .numberLines }
#store a number in a variable called 'test_var'
test_var = 10

#retrieve the variable
print(test_var)

#update the variable
test_var = test_var + 1
print(test_var)
~~~

## Looping 

When we want to avoid repeating lots of code, we can use a loop. Here we store the number of times we've already done the loop
in a variable called `loops`.
