# Variables

If we want a computer to remember something, we have to use a variable. Variables allow us to store and then retrieve data.

We use the single `=` to assign a number to a variable. Variables can be called pretty much anything, but there can be no spaces in the name. It's a good idea to choose a name that matches the variable's use. So if I need a variable to count loops, I could call it `loops`.

~~~ { .python .numberLines }
#store a number in a variable called 'a'
a = 10

#retrieve the variable
print(a)

#update the variable
a = a + 1
print(a)
~~~

# Looping 

When we want to avoid repeating lots of code, we can use a loop. Here we store the number of times we've already done the loop
in a variable called `loops`.
