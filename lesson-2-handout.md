# Variables

If we want a computer to remember something, we have to use a variable. Variables allow us to store and then retreive data.
We can call variables pretty much what we want. In the following example I used `a`, but I could have called it `my_number`.
It's best to name a variable after what we're going to use it for.

~~~ { .python .numberLines }
#store a number in a variable called 'a'
a = 10

#retrieve the variable
print(a)

#update the variable
a = a + 1
print(a)
~~~

# Looping 

When we want to avoid repeating lots of code, we can use a loop. Here we store the number of times we've already done the loop
in a variable called `loops`.
