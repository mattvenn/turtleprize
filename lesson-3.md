# Introduction

In the 2nd lesson, students learnt more about Python, including how to implement loops and use variables. We also covered Sabotage, a game to improve resiliance to syntax errors.

# Learning objectives

* Students will learn some more advanced graphical techniques
* Students will learn about conditionals
* Students will learn to find documentation on libraries using the internet

# Resources

* 15 copies of [lesson 3 handout](lesson-3-handout.html)

# Lesson Summary

* Introduce conditionals
* Work on competition entries, make use of a conditional
* Introduce new turtle techniques

## Conditionals : 15 minutes

In our programs so far we have only covered sequences and looped sequences. When we want our program to do something different depending on its enviromnent, we need to use conditionals. 

Ask the students for examples of computer games they play. Then ask them what conditionals there are in the games. For example:

* In a driving game, if the speed is too high, the car might skid
* In a platform game, once a character's life points are too low, they die
* In a shoot-em-up, once an enemy has been hit it dies

Ask the students to look at the *conditional statement* in their handout.

***conditional_demo.py

Ask them what colour the turtle will draw with the variable `loops` set to 5. Ask what `loops` would need to be to change the colour to red or green?

## Work on their Turtle Prize entry : 30 minutes

* Ask the students to work on their competition entry, and to make use of a conditional statement to change the colour, or another graphical parameter (such as line width).
* Encourage students to experiment with the *fill* and *stamping* options detailed in the handout.
* Encourage students to use the internet to search for other turtle techniques, starting with the link in the handout.

## Plenary : 15 minutes

Remind students that they've learnt the fundamentals of computer programming, recap on the meanings of:

* sequences
* loops
* data
* conditionals
* operators

That programs are made of sequences of instructions that can be looped.
That different sequences can be run using conditional statements.
That they can create and be creative with computers and computer programming.

### Enter the competition!

Ask the students to add their names, class and school and your email to the top of the code using comments (shown in the handout)
Then ask them to submit their code to us at [entries@turtleprize.com](email:entries@turtleprize.com).

# Outcome

All students:

* Understand that a conditional allows a computer program to change its behaviour
* Used either stamp or fill in their code

Most students

* Have used a conditional in their competition entry 

Some students

* Have used a conditional to change a different graphical parameter
* Have researched the stamp shapes using the internet
