# Introduction

The turtle prize was created to encourage programming skills in KS3. 
It was created by [cpd for teachers](http://cpdforteachers.com), and sponsored by:

* [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org).
* [Piffin electronics kits](http://piffin.co.uk).

# Learning outcomes

Students will learn:

* it is possible to create graphics by writing a computer program.
* the fundamentals of programming:
    * sequences
    * loops
    * data
    * conditionals
    * operators
* become resilient with solving computer programming syntax errors.
* what a library is and how to use one.

# Lesson plans

* [Lesson 1 - Turtles, sequences, Python & libraries](lesson-1.html)
* [Lesson 2 - Loops, variables, operators & Sabotage!](lesson-2.html)
* [Lesson 3 - Conditionals, fills & stamping](lesson-3.html)

# Required resources

* Python 2.x installed on computers. 

## Checking Python before the lesson

Start Idle, which comes with Python. A window will pop up called the `shell`. Type in this command and press enter:

~~~ python
from turtle import *
~~~

There should be no errors or visible result from this command.
